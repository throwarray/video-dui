# Stream videos with FiveM (GTAV)

Watch videos with friends in FiveM by playing from path/url or streaming with OBS.

## Install

1. Clone or download the required files
2. Edit the `.env` file (see [Configuration](#configuration))
3. Start the resource

```
ensure video-stream
```
When started, the yarn resource should automatically install the required dependencies. If the installation fails you can do so manually with `npm i` and remove the yarn dependency from `__resource.lua`. Note that __npm__ is required to manually install the dependencies. 


## Streaming

The `/video-stream` command will teleport your player to the cinema.

The `/video-stream:set` command can play videos by path/url
- `/video-stream:set "https://example.com/video.mp4"`
- `/video-stream:set D:\video.mp4`
- `/video-steam:set` without arguments stops playback.

To publish to the optional RTMP server configure __OBS__ and _Start Streaming_.

```
Service: Custom Streaming Server
Server: rtmp://localhost/live
Stream key: STREAM_NAME?secret=secret
```

## Configuration

```
PORT=3000 # The port the HTTP server should listen on (open this port)
RTMP_ENABLED=1 # Whether the RTMP server should be enabled (optional*)
RTMP_PORT=1935 # The port the RTMP server should listen on (open this port*)
RTMP_SECRET=secret # A secret required to publish videos to the RTMP server
STREAM_PATH=rtmp://localhost:1935/live/STREAM_NAME # The RTMP stream path
FFMPEG_PATH=c:\ffmpeg\ffmpeg.exe # The path to a custom ffmpeg binary (optional)
```
It's recommended to disable the RTMP feature if you aren't intending to stream from __OBS__. At the very least change the `RTMP_SECRET`
